# Logo
CoMMA's logo is unsurprisingly a comma, "`,`". In the background, a honeycomb pattern recalls CoMMA's ability to work with unstructured mesh. The colors are:
- The `HEX` code of dark blue of the comma and the contour is `#09387C`.
- The `HEX` code of light blue of the honeycomb is `#BFC9DB`.

Three versions are available:
- A squared image withe withe background in `jpg` format
- A `png` version of the previous image but with transparent background
- A `png` version to use on dark backgrounds where the contour is white and the background inside of it is white and the corners are transparent
