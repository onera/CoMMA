The following meshes are tracked using `git lfs`:

 * `naca2d_structured_ansys.msh`: a NACA profile. It is composed of quads only, it does not have a boundary layer. It has been obtained using the *dualizing* script mentioned above; the format, `msh` by `Ansys` (see `meshio` for more info) has been chosen so that it is always recognized as 2D.
 * `raebis.vtu`: a RAE2822 profile. It is composed of quads in the boundary layer and triangles in the far-zone. It is 2D, but since `VTK` always uses 3D arrays for storing points, when read with `meshio` it will appear as being 3D and usual 2D functions of `dualGPy` will fail. Hence, one has to *dualize* it, see the [related `dualGPy` example](https://github.com/albiremo/dualGPy/blob/main/examples/ex_dualize.py): the result is also available, again in `msh`-`Ansys` mode `raebis_ansys.msh`.
