    """For each cell, computes its distance from a boundary as neighbourhood order.
    That is, a cell at a boundary has distance equal to 0, its neighbours 1, the
    neighbours of its neighbours 2, and so on. In a Cartesian grid this is the Manhattan
    norm with respect to the closest boundary cell.

    It uses a BFS A* algorithm to visit all the cells starting from the borders and
    keeping track of the distance walked so far.

    Parameters
    ----------
    neigh_idxs : array-like
        Indices used to recover the neighbours of each cells provided in `neighs`. The
        length is `N_cells + 1`
    neighs : array-like
        Neighbours of each cell.
    wall : array-like
        IDs of the cells composing the wall from which we compute the distance.

    Returns
    -------
    :obj: `np.ndarray` of `int`
        Wall distance

    Notes
    -----
