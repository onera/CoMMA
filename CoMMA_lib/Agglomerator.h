A brief remark about what follows: It used to be something like:
for (CoMMAIndexType i = agglomerationLines_Idx.size() - 2; i > -1; i--) {
  new_line = deque<CoMMAIndexType>(agglomerationLines.begin() + agglomerationLines_Idx[i],
                                   agglomerationLines.begin() + agglomerationLines_Idx[i + 1]);
}
However, if CoMMAIndexType were to be *unsigned*, then i > -1 (or i >=0) would lead
to an infinite loop. So we had to switch to pointers, and backwards ones since we loop
starting from the end.
With indices, we are used to constructions like "from idx[i] to idx[i + 1]". However,
using *backwards* pointers that translates into "from (*ptr) to (*(ptr - 1))"
