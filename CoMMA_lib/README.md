# Welcome to CoMMA

**CoMMA** (COarse Mesh Multigrid %Agglomerator) is a suite of graph algorithms meant to operate on the graph representation of an **unstructured** computational mesh.

The final objective is to give a map between the fine cells and coarse cells in the object representing the coarse cell graph.

The main features of CoMMA are:
- Sequential by zone (i.e. no coupling with graph partitioner);
- Fine faces conservation for coarse levels;
- Optimization of the shape of the coarse cells w.r.t their aspect ratio;
- Connectivity of coarse cells;
- Detection and treatment of anisotropic regions;
- Isotropic agglomeration with structured-like treatment of structured-like regions.

CoMMA is a **header-only library**. A python module can be generated using `pybind11`.

The interface to CoMMA is very simple and consists in only one function [agglomerate_one_level](@ref agglomerate_one_level).
