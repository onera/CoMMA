Some remarks about the implementation. All the work is done in the function "update",
hence that is where we have to focus on. There are only two constraints for the
returned object: it should be an iterable, and the content (the indices of the neighbours)
must be ordered using their weights. An ordered set of pair of (index, weight) with
CustomPairGreaterFunctor as comparator would not work as because we want unique indices
and that would have been quite hard to achieve even if defining a custom operator==,
have a look here, https://stackoverflow.com/a/1114862
We still use sets, but we have an extra check before inserting whether there already is
a pair with the same index.
